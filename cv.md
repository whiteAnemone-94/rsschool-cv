## About Me
I've never worked in the IT-industry, but I've always enjoyed working with computers. After school I decided to study programming at university, but things didn't go as planned and I changed my course of study to linguistics. However, a year ago, I realized that I had the skills to become a developer, so now I'm learning programming again. My goal is to master front-end (or maybe even a full stack, because I have an interest in python too) development and pursue a career in this field in the future.

## Skills:
HTML - Intermediate

CSS - Intermediate

JavaScript - Beginner

Python - Beginner

Git - Beginner

## Languages:
Russian - native

English - C1

## Projects
I used to have a portfolio with projects, but then I realized that many of them weren't so good, and I decided to create a new, better portfolio with better projects. So just wait for the update!

## Education and courses
* ***University***: International Academy of Business and New Technologies (MUBiNT), Bachelor's degree, Faculty of Linguistics and Translation, 2016-2021

## Code example:
*Code example from Codewars: [Handshake problem](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5574835e3e404a0bed00001b)*
```
function getParticipants(handshakes) {
    for (let i = 0; i <= 1000; i++) {
        if ((i**2 - i)/2 == handshakes) {
            console.log(i)
            return i;
        } else if ((((i-1)**2 - (i-1))/2 < handshakes) && ((i**2 - i)/2 > handshakes)) {
            console.log(i)
            return i
        }
    }
}
```
