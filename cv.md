## About Me
I've never worked in the IT-industry, but I've always enjoyed working with computers. After school I decided to study programming at university, but things didn't go as planned and I changed my course of study to linguistics. However, a year ago, I realized that I had the skills to become a developer, so now I'm learning programming again. My goal is to master front-end (or maybe even a full stack, because I have an interest in python too) development and pursue a career in this field in the future.
